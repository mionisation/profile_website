My name is Michael Ion and I specialize in building data intensive systems.

Currently I enjoy using Scala and Python to solve problems, although I believe in using the best tool for the job. On the DevOps side, I use Terraform with AWS amongst others.

I have a Master's Degree (Diplom-Ingenieur) from the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/en).

I speak English & German fluently and am proficient in French & Romanian.

I am always keen to hear about your data project: [Contact me](/contact)
